Set theoretical problem

& ... set intersection  (i as function)
- ... set difference    (d as function)

To show:

X1 & (X2 - X3) = (X1 & X2) - X3

This is done via the "in"-predicate


A x1. A x2. A y. (in(y,d(x1,x2)) <-> (in(y,x1) & ~in(y,x2)));
A x1. A x2. A y. (in(y,i(x1,x2)) <-> (in(y,x1) & in(y,x2)));
~A x1. A x2. A x3. A y. (in(y,i(x1,d(x2,x3))) <-> in(y,d(i(x1,x2),x3)))
