  <h1>Visualisation for the Tableau calculus</h1>

  <p>The Tableau Calculus is a formal method to prove statements in First Order Predicate Logic.
    It is explained in extenso for instance in the 
  <a href="">scriptum to the lecture formal methods (German)</a>.</p>

  <h2>Using the applet</h2>
  <p>A new proof can be started using the <img src="classes/de/uka/ilkd/tablet/img/new.gif">-Button.
    You will be asked to enter one or more formulas spearated by ';'.
    See <A href="#formGram">description below</A> on
    how to enter formulas.
  </p>

  <p>Nodes in the proof are color-coded according to their "type" of formula:</p>

  <table cellpadding="5">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#80ff80" width=50></td>
      <td><b>ALPHA</b></td>
      <td>Non-branching formulas with subformulas (such as A &and; B)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#8080ff"></td>
      <td><b>BETA</b></td>
      <td>Branching formulas with subformulas (such as A &or; B)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#80ffff"></td>
      <td><b>GAMMA</b></td>
      <td>Universally quantified formula (&forall;x. A(x))</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ffff80"></td>
      <td><b>DELTA</b></td>
      <td>Existentially quantified formula (&exist;x. A(x))</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td bgcolor="#ff80ff"></td>
      <td><b>NEGNEG</b></td>
      <td>Special case: Double negation (&not;&not;A), resolves to A</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>You can drag a formula holding your <strong>left</strong> mouse button (formula becomes
    <em>red</em>) onto a leaf of the tree to apply the according rule to this branch. The leaf
    must not be closed. If you want to expand a formula on the spot, you can click on it twice.
    You can also drag a formula with your <strong>right</strong> mouse button pressed (formula
    becomes <em>green</em>) onto a contradictory formula (i.e. A onto &not; A or v.v.) to close
    branches.</p>

  <p>The application of gamma rules create new free variables called
    <code>X<em>n</em></code> with n a natural number.
    These free variables can be instantiated using the  
    <img src="classes/de/uka/ilkd/tablet/img/instance.gif">-button. A message box pops up and you
    can enter the instantiation for one free variable in the form
    <code>X<em>n</em> = <em>formula</em></code>.
  </p>

  <p>You can undo rule applications and instantiations using the 
    <img src="classes/de/uka/ilkd/tablet/img/undo.gif">-button. Please note that closed branches
    may become reopend hereby.
  </p>

<APPLET code="de.uka.ilkd.tablet.TableauApplet" codebase="classes" align="baseline"
          width="700" height="700"/>

  <p>If the formulas are not clearly visible or if you prefer ASCII rather than mathematical
    formulas, you can switch between ASCII and Unicode characters using the
    <img src="classes/de/uka/ilkd/tablet/img/unicode.gif">-button.
  </p>

  <h2>On the notation of formulas</h2>
  <p>
    The grammar for formulas is straight forward and will be presented here by examples.
    Identifiers can be any character string (case sensitive!) starting with a letter (optionally) 
    followed by letters or digits. You must not use <code>X1, X2, ...</code> and 
    <code>sk1, sk2, ...</code> however, for these are reserved for free variables and 
    skolem symbols respectively. </p>
      
  <table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>A x. p(x)</code></td>
      <td>for all x, p(x) holds. p is a predicate here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>E x. p(f(x))</code></td>
      <td>There is a x so that p(f(x)) holds. p is a predicate and f is a function here</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>P &amp; Q</code></td>
      <td>P and Q hold.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>P -&gt; Q</code></td>
      <td>P implies Q</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>P | Q</code></td>
      <td>P or Q</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>P | Q &amp; R</code></td>
      <td>Operators have the usual precedence: &amp; then | then -&gt;. I.e.
        <code>P | Q &amp; R = P | (Q &amp; R)</code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>A x. p(x) | q(x)</code></td>
      <td><strong>Caution!</strong> This is equal to <code>(A x. p(x)) | q(x)</code>.
        Therefore x appears as free variable which may not be. The applet does not check for such
        things, so be aware!
